# Unofficial Translation of "HOW BROWSERS WORK‪:‬ BEHIND THESCENES OF MODERN WEB BROWSER"

My Egyptian Translation of  ‪[‬HOW BROWSERS WORK‪:‬ BEHIND THESCENES OF MODERN WEB BROWSER‪](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/)‬ of by [Tali Garsiel](http://taligarsiel.com) (author) and Paul Irish (editor).


Inspired by [Kosei Moriyama's](http://cou929.nu/) [ project](https://github.com/cou929/Japanese-Translation-of-How-Browsers-Work).


I'm writing everything in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) as it's easy-to-read text-to-HTML conversion tool , and works here,on gitHUB! :D


I'll try to sum things up, as I hate reading as well,isa!
